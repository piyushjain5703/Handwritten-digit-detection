# Handwritten-digit-detection
Neural Network based digit recognization.

**Note : digit should be written on white paper using black ink.**

**while predicting update the image path.**

Current accuracy of model is about 97.5 % .Digit should be in between 0-9.

Model is using very basic neural network with ReLu and softmax function as activation and intialisation of parameters for neural network are done using Henormal().
